# Cryptography Algorithms Collection

This repository contains 13 cryptography algorithms implemented in C++, explaining substitution and transposition cipher techniques. These algorithms provide a basic understanding of cryptography and help learners understand how ciphers work.

✨ **Substitution Ciphers**
Substitution ciphers replace characters in the plaintext with other characters based on specific rules.

✅ **Monoalphabetic (Single Substitution)**
In these ciphers, each letter of the plaintext is replaced with another letter consistently throughout the message.

* **Atbash Cipher:** Reverses the alphabet (e.g., A ⇔ Z, B ⇔ Y).
* **Caesar Cipher:** Shifts letters by a fixed key.
* **Affine Cipher:** Uses the formula (ax + b) mod 26.
* **August Cipher:** A variation of the Caesar Cipher with a fixed shift of 1 (implementation included).

✅ **Polyalphabetic (Multiple Substitutions)**
These ciphers use more than one substitution alphabet to encrypt the message.

* **Vigenère Cipher:** Uses a repeated keyword to shift letters based on the Vigenère square.
* **Gronsfeld Cipher:** A numeric version of the Vigenère cipher using digits (0-9) as the key.
* **Beaufort Cipher:** Similar to the Vigenère cipher but uses reversed logic for encryption.
* **Autoclave / Running Key Cipher:** The key is extended using the plaintext itself or an external text source (e.g., a book).

🔤 **Polygraphic**

* **Hill Cipher:** Employs matrix multiplication and modular arithmetic on blocks of letters.

🛋️ **Transposition Ciphers**
These ciphers rearrange the characters of the plaintext without changing the letters themselves.

* **Rail Fence Cipher:** Writes the plaintext in a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rails and then reads it off row by row.
* **Route Cipher:** The plaintext is written into a grid, and the ciphertext is obtained by reading the letters in a specific path (e.g., spiral, diagonal).
* **Myszkowski Cipher:** A columnar transposition cipher that uses a keyword with repeating letters; the columns are ordered based on the alphabetical order of the keyword's letters, with repeated letters handled uniquely.

🔎 **N-Gram Operations**
* **NGramOperations.cpp:** This file provides functionality to generate unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams from text data. These are useful for various natural language processing tasks such as text analysis, language prediction, and preprocessing.
